        <p>Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is, will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is; what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
